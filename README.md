# A Simple EPICS IOC for the ALS-U EPICS Environment. 

[![Building](https://github.com/jeonghanlee/ioc-demo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jeonghanlee/ioc-demo/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This repository contains selected training materials derived from the internal ALS-U EPICS Environment training program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), shared here for public access and demonstration purposes.

**Note:** As these are selected materials from a larger internal course, they may not represent a complete, step-by-step tutorial, and some logical connections between the examples or steps might be missing compared to the original training sequence.

The ALS-U IOC template structure demonstrated here is based on the general principles found in the [EPICS IOC Template provided by epics-docs](https://github.com/epics-docs/epics-ioc-template). You can refer to that repository for general template background information.
